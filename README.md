# Data-Visualization-for-Car-Financing
In this project I've learnt more about data visualization including graphs, plots, heatmaps and etc..
In this project I've done the following:
- Loaded data as a csv file
- Explored data to know more about it
- Renamed columns so it can be easier to manipulate
- Cleaned data as I deleted columns that's not needed
- Filtered data to work on a specific car type
- Plotted two columns together to get a clear vision
- Created a boxplot and a heatmap
